# Stock Prediction Model

The objective was to train a simple machine learning model to predict Tesla stock prices based on open-source data from 2010-06-29 to 2018-03-27.
We found that, among the algorithms chosen for this experiment, the SVM and Bayesian linear regression models such as Ridge and ARD performed the best with accuracies of 0.954 and 0.939 respectively.
